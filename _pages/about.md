I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Psychology, Harvard University. My academic journey began with a PhD in Applied Mathematics from Fudan University, where I focused on developing and applying mathematical models to study dysfunctional brain circuits in psychiatric disorders. My current research focuses on investigating the organization of large-scale networks within the human brain and their roles in high-level cognitive functions, such as language processing and memory formation. Using multiple behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational approaches, I characterize human brain networks and how variation gives rise to differences in network organization and behavior in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and striatum. Of particular interest to me is the higher-order association cortex, which has disproportionately expanded in the human brain compared to non-human primates. By studying these brain circuits and their roles in cognitive function, I aim to uncover fundamental principles underlying brain organization and function, with implications for understanding psychiatric disorders and human cognition.
